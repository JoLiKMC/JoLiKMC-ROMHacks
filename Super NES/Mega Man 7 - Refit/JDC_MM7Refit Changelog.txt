Mega Man 7 Refit Changelog
===============================================================================

v1.2.0 (07/10/2021) -- Fourth public release!
[SUMMARY]
  Wouldn't you know it?  More graphic changes!  Wowie!
  Also?  I decided to add individual patches for those who want to use bits-
  and-pieces in other Mega Man 7/Rockman 7 hacks.

[CHANGES]
- The following graphics have been changed:
  _GENERAL/GLOBAL_
  - Changed the 1up to a style-matched NES-style head
   (The graphic is, more-or-less, just straight from the Game Gear game.)
  - Changed the Energy Capsules to style-matched NES-style graphics
   (The Weapon Capsules look a little Christmas-y, but I think it works.
    IDEALY, I'd want to have them change palettes with the player, though...)
  - Uncharged Mega Buster shots are one pixel shorter
   (Again, to make them look more like their NES... "lemon"... counterpart.)

  _WEAPON SCREEN_
  - Updated the 1up menu graphic to match the new 1up item
   (It looked... POSSESSED... before.  Now, it looks fine.)

  _TITLE SCREEN_
  - Removed the space between "Pass" and "Word"
   (This isn't a graphical change.  Just a hex change.)

- The following text has been changed:
  - Rewrote the questionable part of the ending
   (It's a little more fitting for both Wily and Rock's characters, now.)

- Other Changes
  - Broke the ROM hack down into individual patches for use with other hacks
   (It seemed like my complete hack was breaking other hacks, so I figured I
    should give people the option to pick-and-choose.
    A "complete" patch is STILL available, however!)
  - Updated the Readme to reflect the new assortment of available patches

[NOTES]
- Due to how the Energy Meters work, it's not really feasible to try and make
  them mimic the NES-style (black background) ones.  I tried just deleting the
  tops and bottoms, but that revealed that the meters work by OVERLAYING TILES
  rather than using individual ones, as per the NES games.  So... that's fun.
----------

v1.1.7 (07/09/2021 (!))
[SUMMARY]
  Changed s'more text strings.

[CHANGES]
- The following text has been altered:
  - The start-up screen now reads "licensed" instead of "licenced"
  - Auto says some different things after getting his Hyper Bolt back
   (No real reason.  I just felt like changing things up~)
  - Auto's helmet dialogue in the intro stage has been changed for clarity
   (Again, no real reason.  Just wanted to.)
- Added a missing change on the v1.1.6a update: Burstman's damage data changes
----------

v1.1.6b (01/27/2018)
[SUMMARY]
  Purely a changelog change.  Just forgot to add a couple of things WAY early.

[CHANGES]
- Added the altered values for Megaman's Buster and I-frames to the first entry
 (Thanks, SCD!)
----------

v1.1.6a (12/30/2017)
[SUMMARY]
  After doing some testing, I've decided that people were right about making
  the Charge Shot do more damage to enemies.
  Also, I rebalanced the weapons.  Slightly.

[CHANGES]
- The following damage data changes have been made:
  _ENEMIES/SUB-BOSSES/BASS (INTRO)_
  - FULLY-Charged Shots do 6 damage (up from 4)
   (This makes the charged shot CONSIDERABLY more useful.)
  - WHOLE Freeze Cracker does 4 damage (up from 3 (wut))
    - SHATTERED Freeze Cracker does 2 damage (down from 3)
  - SMALL Noise Crush does 2 damage (down from 4)

  _BURSTMAN_
  - SPLINTERED Freeze Cracker reverted back to base damage (3, up from 2)
  - PLANTED Danger Wrap reverted back to base damage (0, down from 1)
   (I honestly don't remember why I even changed it.)

[NOTES]
- I was going to have Scorch Wheel do 4 damage (down from 8)... but, after
  actually TESTING it, I decided that it wasn't a very good idea.
- For some strange reason, enemies in this game have DOUBLE the amount of
  health that they should.  To compensate, the damage data chart for enemies
  makes most weapons do damage in multiples of 2.
  Thus, the above values ARE correct, even if it doesn't seem like it.
  Interestingly, the Forte Buster does 1 damage, in Rockman & Forte, while
  the Rock Buster and "no weapon energy" shots do 2!
----------

v1.1.5b (03/13/2017)
[FIXES]
- Fixed a couple of typos in the changelog
 (receieved -> recieved) and (frmo -> from)
 (Thanks, Bohepans!)
----------

v1.1.5a (03/12/2017, same day)
[SUMMARY]
  Little changes, little fixes...

[CHANGES]
- The following graphics have been changed:
  _GENERAL/GLOBAL_
  - Changed the 4-color Capcom logo to the one from Mega Man 6
  - Replaced the following Mega Man 10 text font characters with
    Mega Man 6 counterparts:
    Apostrophe ('), comma (,), colon (:), copyright symbol (©)
  - Replaced the Mega Man 10 text font semi-colon (;) character with a custom
    Mega Man 6-styled semi-colon
  - Removed the shading from the copyright symbol

  _WEAPON SCREEN_
  - The following secondary screen items have had their initials changed:
    Rescue Service (RS) -> Beat's Whistle (BW)
    Punch Item (?) (PU) -> Rocket Buster (RB)
   (Thanks for the inspiration, Bohepans!)
  - Changed the 1up icon to a 16-bit-styled edit of the NES graphic
   (I may change this back in the future if people really don't care for it.)

[FIXES]
- Nudged the question mark (?) over by one pixel
----------

v1.1.3 (03/12/2017)
[SUMMARY]
  Fixing a change that I made which seemingly got reverted later on.

[FIXES]
- Protoshield now plays sound 1A (normal deflection) when deflecting things...
  for REALS this time!
 (This apparently got reverted some time after v1.0.6...)
----------

v1.1.2 (02/25/2017, same day) -- Third Public Release!
[SUMMARY]
  Fixed some minor things that I missed before.

[FIXES]

  _GET WEAPON SCREEN_
  - The word "REFIT" has been redone a little to match the title screen

- The following items received revised descriptions in Big Eddie's shop:
  - Auto now tells you the CORRECT function of Weapon Tanks
   (Thanks again, Bohepans!)
----------

v1.1.0 (02/25/2017) -- Second Public Release!
[SUMMARY]
  Did a little tinkering to make the rest of the cutscene text skippable.

[CHANGES]
- You can now skip/speed up certain parts of dialogue:
  - All Weapon Get cutscenes
  - All Light Lab cutscenes (including weapon explanations)
  - The post-Wily battle cutscene (before the ending)
- Sped up Megaman's out-of-character outburst in the post-Wily battle scene

[FIXES]
- Fixed a typo in the changelog (recieved -> received)
- Fixed a typo in the Readme (invulernability -> invulnerability)
----------

v1.0.8 (02/24/2017)
[SUMMARY]
  Fixed a couple oversights and did some text editing.

[CHANGES]
- The following items received revised descriptions in Big Eddie's shop:
  - Rush Jet is a bit more descriptive
  - Rush Search tells you EVERYTHING it can do
  - Hyper Rocket Buster is a bit more accurate
  - Exit Unit is named
  - The Tank item descriptions look a little nicer, too
- You can now skip/speed up certain parts of dialogue:

   (after Auto stops and most of the Dr. Light conversation)
  - Protoman's battle dialogue
  - Both encounters with Bass in the Wily Stages
  - All the non-weapon Light Lab cutscenes

[FIXES]
- Added the shadow to the CORRECT "waiting for input" cursor
 (Turns out the US ROM still uses the Japanese text cursor for that.)
- [VANILLA BUG] Moved cursor into dialogue box in Wily Stage 2 Bass fight
----------

v1.0.6 (02/23/2017, later that day)
[SUMMARY]
  Once more, from the top!  DS figured out the code for Rush/Protoshield.

[CHANGES]
- Protoshield now plays sound 1A (normal deflection) when deflecting things

[FIXES]
- Protoshield now plays a noise when deflecting things again
 (You da man, DarkSamus993!)
----------

v1.0.5 (02/23/2017)
[SUMMARY]
  And again, DarkSamus993 saves me a bunch of time and frustration by giving
  me the answers to my "disable Rush collision" problems!
  Also, some other little things.

[CHANGES]
- Rush (Coil, Jet, Search) no longer flinches when bumping into an enemy
 (Huge thanks AGAIN, DarkSamus993!)
  This does have a side-effect of making the Protoshield silent, however
 (See the Bugs section of the Readme for more details)
- The following graphics have been changed:
  _MEGA MAN/BASS_
  - The Charge Shot sparks have been put back into their bank
   (The Charge Shot spark EFFECT is still disabled, however.)
----------

v1.0.1 (02/22/2017, later that day)
[SUMMARY]
  The Charge Shot sparks have been COMPLETELY eliminated from the game!
 (In areas which were sprite-heavy (such as any area with a DeliPipi or the
  Wily Machine fight), there was still sprite flicker when charging.  The code
  which generates the sparks has now effectively been disabled.)

[FIXES]
  _MEGA MAN/BASS_
    - The Charge Shot sparks have been DISABLED rather than erased
     (Huge thanks to DarkSamus993 to finding the solution to this one!)
----------

v1.0.0 (02/22/2017) -- Initial Public Release!
[SUMMARY]
  Decided to put off releasing it until today.  Had a very busy Feb. 21st.
  Also, fixed a couple of very minor things.

[FIXES]
- The following graphics have been changed:
  _GENERAL/GLOBAL_
  - Fixed an overhanging pixel from the comma in the dialogue font
   (Since it was in character 2C (<), it's only noticeable in the ending,
    but eh...)
    - Also added a shadow to the "Waiting for input" cursor
----------

  _WEAPON SCREEN_
  - The weapon/item name fonts have been changed to the Mega Man 4-6
    weapon screen font

  _GENERAL/GLOBAL_
  - The dialogue font now has a drop shadow
   (I originally thought it looked ugly... but it looks fine today.  Weird.)

  _PASSWORD SCREEN_

  - The dot matrix font has been changed to a double-sized, dot matrix variant
    of the NES Mega Man font

[FIXES]
- The following changes have been made to the following bosses (SPOILERS):
  _BURSTMAN_
  - SHATTERED Freeze Cracker does 2 damage (down from 3) FOR REAL this time
   (I said that I'd implemented this a few versions ago.  I did not.  Oops.)
----------

v0.7.0 (01/30/2017)
[SUMMARY]
  DarkSamus993 helped implement the weaknesses I ORIGINALLY planned.
  He also completely re-coded the boss damage tables.
 "All that was needed after relocating the routines was to add a compare/
  branch for each new weapon." - DarkSamus993

  Also, the ROM hack is now called "Retrograde X," due to DarkSamus' becoming
  a bit more directly involved in things.

[CHANGES]
- The boss weakness routines and damage data charts have been relocated to some
  previously empty space in the ROM
 (This was done to allow more flexibility with boss vulnerabilities.)

  _BURSTMAN_
  - Wild Coil does 0 damage again (back down from 1 and 1)
  - Rocket Buster reverted back to base damage (0, down from 1)

- Burstman no longer gains invulnerability frames from his immunities
 (His Wild Coil immunity had to be sacraficed for this to happen.)
- Springman no longer gains invulnerability frames from his immunities
 (Additional vulnerabilities had to be added for this to happen.)
----------

v0.5.2 (01/22/2017)
[SUMMARY]
  Changed Protoman's "weakness flinch."

[CHANGES]

  _NOTE ABOUT THE "Despite what it looks like" ENTRIES_
    I made it so Noise Crush and Wild Coil don't harm Burstman but a placed
    Danger Wrap mine will.  Using Noise Crush or Wild Coil still triggers his
    I-frame state and plays both the "hurt" and the "blocked attack" noises.
    Same goes for Springman and his new invulnerability, the Rocket Buster.
    Inversely however, using Danger Wrap (mines) against Burstman will fail to
    trigger his I-frame state, as well as hitting him twice (due to the cluster
    of explosions) and allowing for further damage.

    Quite frankly, I have no idea why this happens.  It doesn't happen with any
    of the other bosses with new vulnerabilities (which mostly consists of the
    fortress bosses anyway...) or invulnerabilities, so I'm just kinda left
    scratching my head.
    I should probably test this more, in fact... see if this is a global thing
    or just limited to specifically the two Robot Masters sitting across the
    way from each other in-terms of data and capsule location.
