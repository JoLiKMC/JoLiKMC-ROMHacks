Illusion of Gaia - Sprint Button (for Beta) Addresses
===============================================================================
[0. (FORE) FOREWORD]

    All of the work done for this hack is BASED ON the work of C-Dude's
original "IoG Sprint Button" ROM hack (https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/7295/).
However, none of his work was used for this patch.
    All addresses were manually located and changed by me, Josephine Lithius,
based on what he did and based on what Raeven0 found in the code.
    The original US ROM values are listed here along with what they do just for
the sake of transparency and full disclosure.

    For further information, please check the original ROM hack documentation.
