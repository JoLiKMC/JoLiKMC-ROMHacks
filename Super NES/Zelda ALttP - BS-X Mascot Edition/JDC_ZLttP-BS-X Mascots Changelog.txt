"The Legend of Zelda: ALttP, BS-X Mascot Edition" Changelog
===============================================================================

v1.0.3 (04/09/2017) -- Second released version!
[SUMMARY]
  BohepansTheThird found something I didn't.
  He also figured out how to actually ACCESS the thing I couldn't figure out.

[FIXES (GIRL VERSION)]
- Fixed a text overflow when talking to Sahasralah for the FIRST TIME only
  AFTER getting the Pendant of Courage
 (I honestly had no idea of how to access this dialogue before now.)

[README]
- Added another note about using "beat" to apply BPS patches to ROMs
 (I recently found out beat acts weird if there's a date/time mismatch between
  a patch and a ROM file.  No big deal.)
- Added a Special Thanks that I somehow keep forgetting to add: YY!
 (They made YY-CHR.)
----------

v1.0.1 (04/01/2017) -- First released version! (No joke.  Waka-waka~)
[SUMMARY]
  Hey, guess what I did again?  Oops!

[FIXES (BOY VERSION)]
- Changed the "wanted" portrait back to the male one
 (I'd accidentally added it last version when I was fixing the sword thing.)
----------

v1.0.0 (04/01/2017)
[SUMMARY]
  Changed one and fixed one last thing in both versions.

[CHANGES (BOTH VERSION)]
- Changed the palette of the player's hands when Gloves are equipped
 (The original silver and green colors are now silver and gold instead.)

[FIXES (BOTH VERSION)]
- Fixed a VERY weird bug that exclusively appeared during the ending
 (For some reason, editing the tiles for the Japanese subtitle in certain ways
  will make the tip of player's sword appear corrupt during "[Player]'s Uncle
  Recovers" part of the ending.  I relocated one of the tiles to another
  location and... that seemed to fix it.  And for the curious, what overwrote
  those tiles is the words "Girl" and "Edition" for the title screen.)
----------

v0.9.6 (03/31/2017)
[SUMMARY]
  Fixed a couple of things I'd missed before.

[CHANGES (GIRL VERSION)]
- Changed a missed male pronoun to a gender-neutral one in the Tower of Hera
 (The dialogue where Sahasralah tells you about the Moon Pearl.)

[FIXES (GIRL VERSION)]
- Changed the "wanted" portrait back to the female one
 (I'd accidentally added it last version when I updated the title screen.)
----------

v0.8.4 (03/28/2017)
[SUMMARY]
  Customized the title screens of both versions.

[CHANGES (BOTH VERSIONS)]
- Added "BS-X Mascot  [Gender] Version" to the title screen
 (This came at the cost of removing the "A Link to the Past" subtitle due to
  tile limits, since I didn't want to needless expand the ROM.)

[CHANGES (GIRL VERSION)]
- Changed how the ears of the Bunny Form sat on the upward-facing sprite
 (Also changed how the hair sat, a little)

[FIXES (GIRL VERSION)]
- Fixed a text overflow when buying a bottle from the street merchant in
  Kakariko Village
----------

v0.7.0 (03/26/2017)
[SUMMARY]
  Decided to scrap the existing edited ROMs for personal reasons and started
  over with fresh ones.  I also started work on the Boy Version of the hack.
