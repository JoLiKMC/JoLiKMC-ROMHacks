[2. (INDU) INTRODUCTION & QUESTIONS]

- "What is 'Simple HUD Font'?"
  It's a ROM hack that replaces the default Faxanadu HUD and menu font.

- "What does this ROM hack do?"
  It's a ROM hack that… replaces the default Faxanadu HUD and menu font.

- "Yes, but can you elaborate?"
  Ah.  Well, in original release of Faxanadu, the HUD and menu fonts used a
  fancy-looking font that was somewhat difficult to read.  When the game was
  translated and released in the US, Nintendo decided to keep that font and
  use it for dialogues and the password system.  When Revision 1 came around,
  though, they changed the dialogue font into something a little easier on the
  eyes.  The HUD font was not changed, however.
  
  This ROM hack "ports" the Revision 1 dialogue font over to the HUD for ease
  of readability.

- "What's with all the variants?"
  I dunno.  I was bored.  I like the shadow one best, myself!

- "Will these patches work on ANY version / region of Faxanadu?"
  Yes, actually!  The graphics locations are consistent across all four
  regional variants of the game!  However, I cannot guarantee that the patches
  will work with all ROM hacks.
  
  So, it probably won't work if the ROM hack upends the game code or
  significantly rearranges data.  It MIGHT work if the hack you're thinking of
  just changes the HUD font.  It will DEFINITELY work on clean, vanilla ROMs.

[4. (HOTO) HOW TO USE]

  Things You'll Need
  - The IPS file(s) that SHOULD have come with this TXT file
  - An unmodified game ROM matching one of these descriptions:
    Faxanadu (Japan)
      Size: 266,240 bytes -- CRC32: F9E6E6AD
    Faxanadu (USA)
      Size: 266,240 bytes -- CRC32: 63464FD
    Faxanadu (USA) (Revision 1)
      Size: 266,240 bytes -- CRC32: B6F4F544
    Faxanadu (Europe)
      Size: 266,240 bytes -- CRC32: 272826CF
   (I will NOT provide these!  Sorry~)
  - A program to apply IPS files to ROMs
  - A system emulator or flash cart to play the game

  Suggested Programs
  - ROM HASHING: ROMhacking.net's Hasher-js (https://www.romhacking.net/hash/)
    It's ALWAYS a good idea to check your ROM's "CRC32" hash.  That way, there
    can be no mistake about the patches and such!

  - PATCHING: Floating IPS (http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1040/) or
              beat (http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/893/)
    Floating IPS is easy to use and very reliable.
    beat would work just fine, too.  I just prefer FLIPS.
    
  - EMULATION: Famicom Emulator Ultra X (https://fceux.com/web/home.html)
    Always and forever, the best there ever was.  At least in my eyes.
    It's still getting updated, too, so there's something!

  How to Apply the patches to the ROM, The Simple Way
  - Toss your UNMODIFIED ROM and the IPS patch from this archive into
    into the same directory as your patching utility of choice.
  - Open your patching utility.  Direct it to the ROM and patch.
  - Do the command that makes the ROM patched. (Varies by-program.)
  - If everything went well, your ROM should be patched.
    NO CHANGE IN SIZE SHOULD OCCUR.  If it does, something may have gone wrong.
  - Enjoy!

  IF ROM DOES NOT RUN, you more than likely tried to apply the wrong patch to
  the wrong ROM or wrong type of ROM.

I mean it.  Don't make me wag my finger at you.

    This ROM hack was originally released EXCLUSIVELY to ROMhacking.net.  If
you found it anywhere else, THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE!  I don't mind!  Just know
that the version at ROMhacking.net is ALWAYS going to be the most up-to-date!
  
    Use of this ROM hack IS ALLOWED under a public-domain-equivalent license,
so go nuts.  If you RELEASE you ROM hack with this modification, though, it
would be a REALLY nice gesture if credited me for the original changes.
You don't HAVE to, but I'd certainly appreciate the hey-ho!
