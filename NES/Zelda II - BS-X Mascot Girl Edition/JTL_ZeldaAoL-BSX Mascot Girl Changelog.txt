[SUMMARY]
  Finally implemented the spritework into the game!

[CHANGES (NES)]

 (Due to the Crouching Thrust sprite lunging forward by 8 pixels,
  the original idea I had (a simple kneeling stab) couldn't be used.)

 (13 side-scrolling pages, 12 palace pages, and 1 overworld page.
  Gotta love the MMC1 mapper with its "redundant" sprite pages!  :D)
