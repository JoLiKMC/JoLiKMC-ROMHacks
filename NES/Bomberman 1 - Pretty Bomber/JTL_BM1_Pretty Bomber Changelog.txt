"Bomberman, Starring Pretty Bomber" Changelog
===============================================================================
v1.1.0 (09/24/2019)
[SUMMARY]
  Upon the indirect recommendation of Googie, I went ahead and upgraded all
  of the enemy graphics to their relevant PC-Engine counterparts!

[MAJOR CHANGES (Both)]
- Replaced the following sprites with PC-Engine-styled versions in-ROM:
  ALL enemies except Doll (the Japanese lantern-looking enemy)
  (NOTE: A vast majority of the sprites look ROUGHLY THE SAME as the originals,
         though a lot of them DO look a bit nicer.  I guess Hudson Soft just
	 added more colors to the PC-Engine version's enemies, and such.)
- Applied minor touch-ups on the following sprites:
  Doll (the Japanese lantern-looking enemy)
  Oneal (the water drop-looking critter)
  Pass (the tiger-looking thing)
- Replaced the original font with the font from Bomberman Jetters (GBA)
  (It's thinner and looks less generic.)
----------

v0.7.0 (09/22/2019)
[SUMMARY]
  Found out the ROM I was using was a bad dump (and OVERDUMP, in fact), so I
  had to transfer all my work over into a new ROM.  And, apparently, I was
  using a Japanese overdumped ROM, so... I had to redesign the title screen to
  accomodate, since the US title screen has no border or background.
  (It still looks nice with my edits, though.  Just... bland.)
  And, yes, I probably could have made it work with the border AND the new
  additions on the US version.  I just... didn't feel like it.
  (This was easier.)

[MAJOR CHANGES (U)]
- Transfered all work from a bad Japanese ROM to a recognized US ROM
- Removed the top and bottom lines of the original title screen to fit it to
  the US title screen
- Recolored the title screen sprites to match the style of the US title screen
----------
