Rockman Mega World "Fixer Upper" Changelog
===============================================================================

v1.0.5 (11/03/2022)
[SUMMARY]
  Added the "SRAM patch" to all versions of the game.

_ROCKMAN MEGA WORLD (J), MEGA MAN: THE WILY WARS (E, U) CHANGES_
- Added "SRAM" patch to all versions of the game that needed it.
 (It was the only way to get it to run on real hardware... for now.)
- Fixed the region code on the newly-patched (E) version.
 (The patch by MottZilla changes it to a USA ROM for some reason.)

_ALL VERSIONS_
- Fixed the checksum of all ROMs.
 (Most emulators and some hardware wouldn't care.  I, however, do.)

_README DOCUMENT_
- Added several more Special Thanks credits.
 (Forgot to credit Christian Maas for his hex editor!)

v1.0.3 (11/01/2022)
(NOTE: All patches share the same version number, again.)
[SUMMARY]
  Undid an accidental change that made Quick Boomerang go berserk under certain
  circumstances.  Also made patches for the US versions of the game.
  
[CHANGES]
_ALL VERSIONS_
- Reverted the "cooldown" value of Thunder Beam / Fire Storm / Item-2 / Item-3
  from 01 to 08... as this ALSO affects Quick Boomerang.
 (This is the "secondary cooldown" on Quick Boomerang, used when all
  projectiles have left the screen.  Setting it to 01 means that at point-blank
  range, Quick Boomerang fires a projectile EVERY OTHER FRAME.  Oops.
  Curiously, Needle Cannon DOES NOT use this value for its "re-fire".)

_PATCH FILES_
- Created patches for the "Genesis Mini" and "Retrobit" USA ROMs.
 (ONE value being in the wrong place prevents these from being ONE patch.)
- Added regional labels (J, U, E) to each patch.

_CHANGED ADDRESSES DOCUMENT_
- Added the USA-GM and USA-RB values for everything.
 (WHY is the I-Frame value displaced by $18 in the Retrobit ROM...?)

_README DOCUMENT_
- Added informative descriptions to the document index.
- Added a credit to the creators of GENS-RR.
 (It was half of the toolset I used to find the values!)

v1.0.2 (10/29/2022) -- Unreleased
(NOTE: There's no v1.0.2 patch for the (E) ROM as nothing was changed there.)
[SUMMARY]
  Undid an accidental change that made Needle Cannon go berserk.
  
[CHANGES]
_ROCKMAN MEGA WORLD (J) CHANGES_
- Reverted the "cooldown" value of Needle Cannon from 01 to 08.
 (That was ENTIRELY an accident.)

_CHANGED ADDRESSES DOCUMENT_
- Added the CORRECT Europe values for Quick Boomerang and Needle Cannon.
 (This was an afterthought since I didn't plan to change those values anyway.)
--

v1.0.1 (10/29/2022) -- Initial Release!
(NOTE: There's no v1.0.1 patch for the (E) ROM as nothing was changed there.)
[SUMMARY]
  Fixed a couple of errors that I'd made with the Japanese version.  Oops.
  
[CHANGES]
_ROCKMAN MEGA WORLD (J) CHANGES_
- Applied the patch to a CLEAN Japanese ROM and redid the patch dump.
 (Apparently, I was using a pre-patched ROM without realizing it...)
- Applied copy protection override / "enable code" on Japanese ROM.
 (Thanks, gedowski!)
- Increased the speed of the default weapon by 33% when firing LEFT.
 (I somehow forgot to apply this code the first time around...)

v1.0.0 (10/29/2022)
[SUMMARY]
  Converted some (J) codes to (E) and implemented them into the ROM hacks.
  
[CHANGES]
_GENERAL CHANGES_
- Converted a bunch of patch codes / values from (J) region to (E) region.
- Applied copy protection override / "enable code" on Europe ROM.
 (Allows the modifications to work.  Thanks, Tony Hedstrom!)
- Changed the enemy I-Frames value from 08 to 01.
- Increased the speed of the default weapon by 33%.
 (Thanks again, Tony Hedstrom!)

    Rock Buster, Thunder Beam / Fire Storm / Item-2 / Item-3, Item-1,
    Shadow Blade, Rush (all 3), Magnet Missile, Metal Blade, Search Snake,
    Spark Shock, Bubble Lead, Hard Knuckle
   (Thunder Beam, Fire Storm, Item-2, and Item-3 share the same cooldown.)
- Reduced the "shoot" animation delay from $14 to $10.
