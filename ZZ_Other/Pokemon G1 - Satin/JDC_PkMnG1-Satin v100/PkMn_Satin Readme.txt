1. [WITT] Explanation of ROM Hack - "What is this thing?"

    Simply put, "Pokémon Red/Blue Satin" (or just "Pokémon Satin") is a ROM
hack that replaces everyone's favorite mute player character, Red/Ash, with a
character created during the early development days of Pocket Monsters.
This character was dropped from the game early on and no particularly useful
information about her exists.  She only appears in one piece of official art,
though her design was re-used for the character "Green" (or "Blue" in Japan)
in the Pokémon Adventures comic as well as a different version appearing in
the Pocket Monsters Craft DX books.
    In any case, I decided it was high time that "Green" made her playable
debut in the Pokémon universe.  And so... work on this ROM hack began.

    The intention of this hack is to allow players to play through Gen I games
as the discarded female character.  That's all.  There's no gameplay changes,
no (base game) bug-fixes, nothing like that.  However, I did end up changing
some dialogue here and there... since I can't leave well-enough alone.  I
also may have changed a couple of minor, non-game engine-related things...

2. [WDYC] ROM Hack Features - "What exactly did you change?"

[FULL VERSION]
- Play as Green!:
    This is the big one.  Ash/Red/Jack is no longer in the game.  Instead,
    you now play as Green ("Blue"), the missing girl character from the
    development artwork of Pocket Monsters!
- Some changes to dialogue:
    Some story elements have been enhanced or fleshed-out while other bits
    have had minor tweaks done to them, either for clarity or pronoun reasons.
- A couple of sprites changed here or there.
- Some in-game events may be ever-so-slightly different.
- There's also one somewhat out-of-the-way easter egg...  Can you find it?

[PLAYER-ONLY VERSION]
- Play as Green!  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE IS CHANGED ANYWHERE.
    This version should be compatable with other ROM hacks... but not all!
    (See Bugs below.)

4. [HDII] Installation Instructions - "How do I install it?"

NOTE: These instructions assume you have Lunar IPS and the appropriate ROM
      file(s).  Do not ask me where to find ROM files.  I will not tell you.

-------------------------- ** EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ** -------------------------
  Make sure to use THE APPROPRIATE COLOR PATCH for the APPROPRITE COLOR ROM!
       The "Red" patches WILL NOT WORK  on a "Blue" ROM and vice-versa!
 Applying the wrong patch to the wrong game will NOT update the player sprites
 at bare minimum, or in the worst case,  make the game unstable or unplayable.
 In addition, these patches  WILL NOT WORK ON YELLOW VERSION OR JAPANESE ROMS.
   These patches MUST be applied to US/European Red/Blue Version ROMs ONLY.
-------------------------- ** EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ** -------------------------

 STEP 0: Make sure your ROM file(s) and patches are somewhere you can easily
        find them. (For example, "C:\Downloads" would be a fine place.)
 STEP 1: Open Lunar IPS.exe and click "Apply IPS Patch."
 STEP 2: Find the appropriate patch for the appropriate ROM.
         Select it and click the "Open" button.
 STEP 3: Find the appropriate ROM for the patch you just selected.
         Select it and click the "Open" button.
 STEP 4: Lunar IPS should display a dialogue box reading:
         "The file was successfully patched!"
         Your should be ready to play your newly-patched game.

5. [WDBV] Change Log - "What's the differences between versions?"

    I've gotten into the habit of making seperate documents for my change log.
That said, if you want to know the history of this hack, pop open this file:

			    PkMnSatin_ChangeLog.txt

    It shows every step of the hack's history to the most recent version!  But
it may also show some spoilers for things later on... so if you're fine
that, go ahead and pop it open!
----------

6. [ATAB] Known Bugs and Glitches - "Are there any bugs?"

    As far as I can tell, this thing works just fine on BASE Red and Blue...
It also works on some US-based ROM hacks such as Pokémon Brown and Indigo.
However... I haven't had much luck getting it to run with the Sanqui's
Online Pokémon Randomizer.  It DOES work fine Dabomstew's Universal Randomizer,
both BEFORE and AFTER randomizing a ROM, so there's that, at least.

    Otherwise?  There may be a typo here or there that I missed.

7. [WMTP] Special Thanks - "Who made this possible?"

- Chaos Rush of ROMhacking.net
  (http://www.romhacking.net/?page=submissions&action=submissions&id=20235)
    He directed me to the PokéCommunity Forums.  More specifically...

- Mateo/Luna of Skeetendo (http://skeetendo.nfshost.com/user/4/)
    She directed me to the PokeRed GitHub project -- a disassembly of the
    original Pokémon Gen I games.  Without this, the ROM hack would've been
    significantly harder to do, if not impossible for my skill set.

- The Skeetendo Community (http://skeetendo.nfshost.com/)
    They disassembled Pokémon Gen I and made hacking the thing INCREDIBLY
    simple and easy compared to earlier methods.

- ShantyTown of the PokéCommunity Forums
  (http://www.pokecommunity.com/member.php?u=419788)
    He made an EXTREMELY helpful video about getting the PokeRed GitHub
    project installed on your computer.  I was really having a hard time with
    the instructions given on the project itself, but his video got me goin'!

- D.C. (No relevant link)
    For helping me name the hack and creative input.

- BohepansTheThird (https://www.youtube.com/BohepansTheThird)
    As always, his moral support of my silly projects is always appreciated.
    Also kind of the spell/grammar-checker for this one.

- Nintendo, Game Freak, Ape/Creatures Inc., The Pokémon Co.
  (Do I really need to link these guys?)
    For an awesome game series that even to this day continues to be loved by
    people of all ages, walks of life, and everything in-between.
