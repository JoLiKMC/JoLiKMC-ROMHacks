### [2. (INDU) Introduction & Questions]

- "What is 'Jo Li's ROM Hack Repository'?"<br>
It's… a repository of ROM hacks created by me, Josephine Lithius, aka "Jo Li". I mean, it's right there in the title!  

- "What is the purpose of this repository?"<br>
The purpose is to collect all the various version of ROM hacks I've created and put them all in one place where people can easily access them.

- "Isn't that what *ROMhacking.net* is for?"<br>
Well, two things…

1. *ROMhacking.net* is **dead**.  [Effectively](https://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=39405.0), anyway.
2. *ROMhacking.net* didn't have every version available.  Just the most recent ones.

- "Did anyone actually request this?"<br>
Not directly, I suppose.  There's been interest in earlier versions of some of my hacks, but it's extremely rare that someone outright asks me for one. I guess this is kind of a "just in case".

    Original game content, "game series", and related ideas and concepts created by specific people and © their parent company or companies.

    These ROM hacks were originally released exclusively to *ROMhacking.net*, but now they can be found here at *GitHub*.  If you found them anywhere else, **that's perfectly fine**!  I don't mind!  Just know that the versions at *GitHub* are **always** going to be the most up-to-date!
  
    Use of these ROM hacks **are allowed** under a public-domain-equivalent license, so go nuts.  If you *release* you ROM hack with this modification, though, it would be a *really nice gesture* if credited me for the original changes.
